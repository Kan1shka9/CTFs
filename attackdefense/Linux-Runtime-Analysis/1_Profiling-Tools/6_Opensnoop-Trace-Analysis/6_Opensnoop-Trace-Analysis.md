#### 6. Opensnoop: Trace Analysis

----

Performance monitoring and tracking tools can provide a wealth of information about a running system. In some cases, they can help identify anomalies which could have been caused by a security incident.

----

In this lab, we will analyze Opensnoop script's trace logs to unearth suspicious activity. Please start the lab, answer the below questions and submit the flags to verify:

- A malicious process was searching for some files on the system. What is the name of that process?
- The malicious process was successful in finding one of the files it was searching for. Provide the complete path of that file.
- The malware had stored some secret in the file it had successfully found. Locate the file and retrieve the secret flag.
- The malware had generated a set of private ssh keys somewhere in the /tmp directory. Provide the complete path where the generated keys were stored?
- The malware had replaced the private ssh keys of a user with the private keys it had generated. What is the name of that user?
